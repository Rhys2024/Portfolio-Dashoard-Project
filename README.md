# Trading-Dashoard-Project

#The Idea for this was to create a web Dashboard with my Stock Portfolio

#This is still a Work-In-Progress.  Was created using the Dash packages for web design with Python

#The "Stocks Scratch Work" Jupyter file was me getting acclomated with yfinance and beginning the design of the bashboard... which was then taken to the next level on the "Dashboard Project" Jupyter File!
